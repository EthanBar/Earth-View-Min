# Earth-View-Min
Google's Earth View extension, without the ads
## How to install
Chrome no longer allows raw .crx files to be run, so there's a few extra steps
1. Download Earth.zip from the releases tab
2. Unzip the file to a spot where you won't move/delete it
3. Open the extensions tab in Chrome
4. Enable developer mode
5. Click `Load unpacked extension...`
6. Select the unziped folder
## How to contribute
- Only upload files that are modifed (You can edit and look at the others from the downloaded .zip)
- Find other bloat, background tasks to delete and remove
